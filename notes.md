# Accessibility and JavaScript: An Unconventional Romance

Hey everyone! First of all, I am incredibly honored to be here. I love Spotify. It's the best 10 bucks a month I spend in my budget!

Anyways, it's been a pleasure to be here and meet some of the developers who work on a product that I literally use every day in some form.

Anyways, welcome to my talk: Accessibility and JavaScript: An Unconventional Romance.

## So who the heck am I?

- I'm a Front End Developer. I actually just hit my 5 year mark officially employed as a developer. I used to work in Drupal for the longest time, but now I am primarily doing React and d3.
- I'm an accessibility blogger. I started my blog, a11y with Lindsey as a way to take the jargon out of accessibility and encourage web developers to make their internet everybody's internet. I've been writing for over 7 months now and it's been quite a journey to say the least.

## Cutting to the chase

> Why does accessibility matter to Spotify?

## Spotify gives joy to people for free or low cost

That's it. I know there's a lot of business and legal reasons that accessibility matters. But when it comes down to it, Spotify gives a lot of people joy, legally, for a very low cost.

I remember learning about Spotify in maybe 2013. I was thrilled because I was only making 35k a year (in DC this is....very very difficult to live on). When I could listen to music for free while I was working as an administrative assistant, it made my days of meaningless tasks go by so much quicker.

I remember when I got my first web dev job starting to invest the 10 bucks a month to get premium and I was thrilled.

It wasn't until I became an accessibility expert TM [quote unquote] that I really started thinking about how people with disabilities either greatly benefited or were excluded from the products I used everyday. I could go on more about this, but it's a major theme in my talk.

## "The Great Divide"

Does anyone remember this article? [checks to see who has]

### if nobody raises their hands

Oh wow! Interesting. Well, to summarize, Chris Coyier wrote it about how there's a large divide between what a "front end developer" is. On one side there are front end developers whose skillsets heavily involve JavaScript. On the other side, there are developers who are heavily focused on Design Patterns, HTML, CSS, and .....accessibility.

Does anyone remember the tweet storm that happened afterward? [change slides]

It was at this exact moment that it became clear to me that there are MANY thought leaders in the JavaScript community who deeply care about accessibility. However, putting "accessibility" on the HTML and CSS side of things wasn't completely unfounded. Some of the worst accessibility issues I've found have been on Progressive Web Apps and Single Page Apps. I've noticed that once I came to the JavaScript side of things, something I found second nature (accessibility) was seen as this magical and mystical thing that only came from learning well written HTML. It's been fascinating for me as someone who was on the HTML/CSS side of things for a long time and is now on the JavaScript side of things.

This whole "conflict" that was probably unintentional about whether JavaScript developers care about accessibility quite honestly defined my whole mission about why I cared about accessibility.

"JavaScript isnâ€™t the enemy of accessibility. Instead, the lack of empathy is."

As you can see from this tweet, it got a decent amount of attention. It was a bold statement that I've certainly made before, just not on a public platform.

Let's dissect that for a second. When I tweeted this I got a lot of people who were like "Hmmm I don't know, I feel like ignorance is." Lack of knowledge is certainly a problem,but knowledge is something that can be remedied. It's willingly not caring about other people that is the enemy.

The reason I point this out is because I believe Chris's article got wildly misunderstood.

<!-- The reason that accessibility is on the HTML/CSS side of things is because of how much HTML and CSS gets minimized by JavaScript developers, while simultaneously being told it's incredibly difficult. -->

A few weeks ago, in London, there was the ReactJS Girls conference. I tuned in for the live stream to watch some of my favorite people speak, including my Marcy Sutton.
